# Battle - Week 3 Challenge
---------------------------

This is the final iteration of the battle challenge from week 3 of Makers Academy.
This challenge was designed to introduce us to the request response cycle and the client/server relationship when creating web applications.
In this iteration, it is possible for a user to play against a fellow player, or alone against an AI that automatically takes its turn.

- How HTTP encodes information sent over the web.
- RESTful APIs.
- The request/response cycle.
- Web templating with HTML/CSS.


Skills
------

- Debugging programs that use multiple languages.
- Using a framework (Sinatra) in your code.
- Structuring the code for apps that have user interaction and visual output.
- Testing apps that have user interaction and visual output.
- Tracing data between the browser and server.

Instructions

Run bundle install
```sh
bundle install

Use rackup to open the app in the web browser
